  My resum√©, portfolio, and development blog. This is where I talk about code,
  tech, my projects, and anything related to my professional life.

  You'll see posts about tools, languages, frameworks, apps, websites and more.
  Mostly I'll talk about my current project, the tooling I'm using and how/why
  I'm doing things this way or that.
