**Hi, my name is Lucas**

and I'm an International IT Business student. I'm also an avid reader, I like
to play videogames and write code in my free time, and I aspire to be a
stoic. Or at least emulate the sage well enough.

With this first post, I want to explain my reasoning for writing a blog, what
I want to accomplish by doing this and what the contents of said blog will be.
Another goal of this post is to answer a few basic questions about myself,
mostly about stuff you can't find out just browsing LinkedIn and Twitter.
