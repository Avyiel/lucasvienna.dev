**Hi, my name is Lucas**

and I'm a Business Informatics student, web developer and translator. I'm also an avid reader, I like to play videogames and write code in my free time, and I aspire to be a stoic. Or at least emulate the sage well enough. With this first post, I want to explain my reasoning for writing a blog, that is, what I want to accomplish by doing this and what the contents of said blog will be.

First in the order of business: why am I writing a blog? Simple: I wish to have a chronological record of my learnings, my work and the evolution of my knowledge over time. My idea was therefore to write posts about the technologies I'm currently using, the scripts I put together, the neat tricks I learn and so on. My other reason is to maybe help someone. I know I enjoy reading a well-put article on using a piece of tech, code etc, and I wish to give back by writing my own (hopefully) well-written articles.

Regarding the content, you can expect to see posts all over the tech spectrum: frontend frameworks, server administration, API development, DevOps, containers, CI/CD pipelines, Unix tools, development environments, hardware, keyboards, audio and maybe more. A somewhat large collection of topics, but I have a large assortment of interests.

So, this is my personal website. It is intended to be my resum√©, portfolio and blog all in one little bundle. I hope to post something every week or so, and I'm currently working on a projects gallery to host my portfolio. I am also working on a "how to write your own portfolio website" article detailing my work on this website.

That will be it for now. I hope to have your eyes again for the next article.
